Got my copy of Linux Format (issue 65) in the post this morning. Looking through the Linux Format Awards section I saw that Gentoo had scooped the best distro award and the best support resource for the forums! I thought that was a pretty amazing result. It also did well in the best free software project of the year. There were also some other greats amongst the winners too such as Unreal Tournament 2004 (with native amd64 port) and nVidia for best hardware support - again great amd64 drivers!
