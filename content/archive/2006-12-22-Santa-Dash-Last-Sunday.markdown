Louise and I did a one mile santa dash last Sunday around the Winter Gardens in Sheffield city centre. It was for the British Heart Foundation and we got a santa suit included in our entry fee to keep forever (don't think many people would want it after we ran a mile in it). I was feeling really out of shape after the Christmas parties and drinking I have done over the last few weeks not to mention muscular atrophy due to being tied to my computer writing up my thesis when I haven't been out drinking!<br />
<br />
The Sheffield Star wrote a short article about it <a href="http://www.sheffieldtoday.net/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=58&ArticleID=1935106">here</a> and Louise thinks she might be in the picture too. Even though I was feeling out of shape I still managed to stay with the front group the whole way round...I was at the back of it but still in the group of front runners. I forgot to start my stop watch but I reckon I managed it in a fair time and I was very out of breath at the end!<br />
<br />
I am hoping to find a local 10 km run for the New Year to help me run off some of the rubbish I have been eating recently. It was good fun and I even have a tacky santa suit should I need one.
