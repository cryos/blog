I gave a talk on the Linux file system back in November last year to the local <a href="http://www.sheflug.co.uk/">Sheffield LUG</a> and kept meaning to put it online so that people who missed it or were interested could access it. So after quite a delay here it is <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I think it is all factually correct but as with everything in life there are no guarantees.<br />
<br />
It was of course written using open source tools and presented on my Acer Ferrari 4005 laptop. It seemed to go down well and sparked off quite a bit of discussion. The guy who requested the talk wasn't actually at the meeting though - so may be you can take a look at it now. I have placed the PDF <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~cryos/LFS-ShefLUG-20051112.pdf">here</a> for all those who would like to take a look.
