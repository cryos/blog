I was just adding a couple of bits to an order with <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon</a> that I started yesterday (I think, may be the day before) and they just increased the prices on three things in my basket <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/sad.png" alt=":-(" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> What is happening? Not the normal pound or two either, Spooks Season 4 (Xmas pressie) went from &pound;27.99 to &pound;31.99, Blue Planet (I like stuff underwater if you haven't noticed) went up from &pound;17.99 to &pound;23.99 and the Final Destination 1-3 box set went up from &pound;15.99 to &pound;21.24!<br />
<br />
I learnt to stop being quite so lazy and found out that by shopping around I could get Spooks Season 4 for &pound;27.99 and the Final Destination box set for &pound;11.99 from <a href="http://www.play.com/">Play.com</a> with free delivery too. I need to stop being so lazy but I don't get why Amazon suddenly put their prices up by so much. Is this the sound of Xmas coming or is there something else I am not aware of? They do Blue Planet at &pound;22.99 though so it wasn't all good news, but they are now way cheaper than <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon</a>...<br />
<br />
I am going to go back to writing my thesis instead of ranting about randomness now <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> May be I should start a new rants category.
