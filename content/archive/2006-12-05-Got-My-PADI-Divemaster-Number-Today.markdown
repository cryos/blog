I got an email from <a href="http://www.padi.com/">PADI</a> member services today with my Divemaster number. I was quite excited to receive it but was hoping I would have the card by now. It is quite special as you keep this number for the rest of your professional qualifications with PADI. It doesn't mean that much if you are not into diving though.<br />
<br />
I might not be able to go diving for quite some time though as I am stuck writing up my thesis as well as being pretty broke due to the way in which PhDs are funded over here. It will be a tough holiday period writing up and being broke but this should be the last one as a student! Hopefully next year will be a good one for work and diving - ideally I will have lots more time to do some development too!
