<span></p>I have begun my journey to the <a href="https://desktopsummit.org/">Desktop Summit</a>, making the flight over from the US to Manchester yesterday. A short stay in Sheffield, and catch up with family before heading out to get my flight to Berlin tomorrow. I will be talking about the work I have done both at and before joining <a href="http://www.kitware.com/">Kitware</a> with the title <a href="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/open-source-visualization-scientific-data">"Open Source Visualization of Scientific Data"</a>. I plan to talk about a range of work from my Google Summer of Code project on <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/>Avogadro</a> and <a href="http://edu.kde.org/applications/science/kalzium/">Kalzium</a> back in 2007, through to some of the exciting work at Kitware in <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a>, <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">ParaView</a> and <a href="http://titan.sandia.gov/">Titan</a> looking at the challenges of large data, remote visualization and how to integrate the web and smartphones/tablets into the scientific data visualization workflow.</p>

<p>Bill Hoffman is also planning to attend, and we will be running a workshop <a href="http://wiki.desktopsummit.org/Workshops_%26_BoFs/2011/CMake_Introduction">introducing CMake</a> on Thursday. This is my first Desktop Summit, although Bill and I have both attended previous aKademy and Camp KDE meetings. I should be in on time to attend the pre-registration event, and will not be leaving until Saturday. Looking forward to a great summit, catching up with some old friends and making some new ones. Now, I think I should try to get some sleep before my flight tomorrow!</p></span><br />
