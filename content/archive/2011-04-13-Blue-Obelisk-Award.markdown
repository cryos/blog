<span><p>At the recent <a href="http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/meetings/spring2011/index.htm">ACS Spring meeting</a> I attended the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Obelisk">Blue Obelisk</a> dinner, where I was honored to receive a Blue Obelisk award, pictured below, for my contributions to Open Data, Open Standards and Open Source. This is largely due to the work I have done on <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/">Avogadro</a>, <a href="http://www.openbabel.org/">Open Babel</a> and other open source chemistry tools.</p>

<p>This was one of the biggest dinners I have had the opportunity to attend, and I got to meet many of the people I have worked with (or used their work), along with several people I had not had the opportunity to work with yet, but hope to in the future. We presented the work we had been doing on <a href="http://quixote.wikispot.org">Quixote</a> project at the chemical information symposium on chemistry and the internet, after attending the <a href="http://quixote.wikispot.org/First_Quixote_Conference_-_22nd-23rd_March_2010">first Quixote meeting</a> the previous week (thank you to <a href="http://www.cse.scitech.ac.uk/events/Hartree_Summary/">Hartree Centre</a> for inviting me to speak there</a>, and sponsoring the event).</p>

<p>These are exciting times, thank you very much to <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/">Peter Murray-Rust</a> for presenting me with the award, and all of the support he has shown, along with his relentless passion for open science. I have only been a part of this for a few years, but Peter has been working on opening up chemistry for decades now.</p></span>
