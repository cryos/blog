We are about to leave for the airport. We are taking a long weekend break in Ireland! Should hopefully be meeting up with Rob Holland (former dev) whilst out there and I will be sampling the local Guinness to see if it really is nicer out there. Get to spend a few days in Dublin and then down to Cork. Should be lots of fun (neither of us have been before).<br />

Best get going - back Tuesday I think <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />
