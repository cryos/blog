It is a very sad day for Europe today - I just read that the software patent directive was forced through as an A item today. I think that after all the objections made about this move by software developers, businesses and even several countries it shows me that democracy in Europe is all but dead. The European Parliament actually asked for the process to be restarted twice!<br />
<br />
I feel very, very disappointed, and hold little hope of the directive being rejected by the European parliament in its second reading. I don't think any good will come of this for anyone but the large corporations.
