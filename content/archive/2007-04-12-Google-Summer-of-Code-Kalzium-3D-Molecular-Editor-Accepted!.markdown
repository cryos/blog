<span><p>I just found out that my <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> (TM) application to work on the Kalzium 3D molecular editor has been accepted! The status just changed to accepted. So over the summer I am going to be working on perfecting the 3D molecular editor in Kalzium. I am so amazingly pleased that my project was accepted and it certainly promises to be an amazing summer where I get to work on a project combining my passions for KDE, Qt, C++ and molecular visualisation!</p>

<p>Time to get some sleep as it has gone 4am in the UK! Thanks to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and everyone at <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> and I am sure there will be lots more to come over the summer.</p></span>
