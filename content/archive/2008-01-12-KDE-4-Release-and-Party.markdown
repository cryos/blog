<span><p>I am sure you have heard by now about the KDE 4.0.0 release made yesterday. Currently my desktop machine is on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic somewhere, my laptop is broken and I only have access to Apple systems... I was able to check out KDE 4 and test it in a VM and it is looking good.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to help with Gentoo packaging of KDE 4 very much at all which is a shame. I should get my desktop back at the end of the month in my new home in Pittsburgh. I also couldn't attend the release event as I am attending my graduation ceremony on the 17th of January. Hope you guys really enjoy the event and if I could have moved things around to attend I certainly would have.</p>

<p>There is lots of stuff I hope to be able to do for KDE 4.1, and more specifically Kalzium, once I get my desktop back at the end of the month. Avogadro already has lots of improvements including a KGraphicsView based periodic table which I think Carsten is interested in me getting into Kalzium 4.1.</p>

<p>Enjoy the release event and remember to raise a glass to those of us unable to make it for various reasons <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></span>
