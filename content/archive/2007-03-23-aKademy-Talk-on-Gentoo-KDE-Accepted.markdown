<span><p>I am pleased to announce that my talk submission on 'Gentoo &amp; KDE' has been accepted. I am really looking forward to attending this year's <a href="http://akademy.kde.org/">aKademy</a> which is being held in Glasgow. I am camping nearby and will certainly make it along to everything on the weekend.</p>

<p>I hope we will have other Gentoo users in attendance, I have learnt in the last few days that we have quite a few KDE developers who use Gentoo and even hang out in #gentoo-kde on Freenode. That channel seems to have more people in there everyday. I have always enjoyed meeting developers and users in real life after hours spent chatting online but have not had chance to make it to many conferences in the last year.</p>

<p>As part of my research in the last week or so I have been checking stuff out in KDE 4 and trying them out. I have to say the <a href="http://kpdf.kde.org/okular/">okular</a> is already looking awesome. It would have been so good to have had this available throughout my PhD work but I think it will be well worth the wait. <a href="http://edu.kde.org/kalzium/">Kalzium</a> is also looking fantastic with its 3D molecular editor. I am hoping to help make it even more awesome this summer too. Hopefully more on that later...</p>

<p>Some other stuff I haven't managed to get working just yet but it is in very heavy development. I only wish I had more time to help out now but finishing my thesis is currently top of my priority list <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> There are new versions of <a href="http://www.digikam.org/">digiKam</a> and <a href="http://www.k3b.org/">K3b</a> in portage that are looking great but personally I can't wait for KDE4!</p></span>
