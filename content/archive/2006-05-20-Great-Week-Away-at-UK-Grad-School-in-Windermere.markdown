I was away 8-12 May at a <a href="http://www.grad.ac.uk/">UK Grad school</a> as part of my PhD. I went away not expecting very much from it at all, and I was so shocked. It was a really useful week away, I met lots of interesting people and learnt a lot about myself. I think it has really helped to get me in the right frame of mind to get my PhD finished and find a great job out in California! It has taken me this long to even touch my blog as I have been so busy at work setting my schedule, agreeing it with my supervisors.<br />
<br />
I also found the time to sign up for the <a href="http://extra.shu.ac.uk/rinr/">researchers in residence</a> scheme and attended the briefing day at <a href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/">Sheffield Hallam University</a> (the other one down the road <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> ). We did lots of really useful stuff at the Grad school such as interview skills (great for me as I am job hunting right now), marketing, negotiation, constructive feedback (the level of honesty was very refreshing) and lots more besides. We also squeezed a lot of socialising in during the few hours they gave us to ourselves!<br />
<br />
I now have an agreed schedule for writing up my thesis and papers. I still have a little lab time I can squeeze in and fingers crossed it should be submitted by the end of September fully complete. I will of course be using my favourite open source tools to write up with and was considering writing an article on open source tools and their use in a scientific PhD. Could be a good one to write while I am waiting for my viva...
