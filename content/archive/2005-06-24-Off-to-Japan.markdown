Well I am off to Japan. I think I managed to get most of everything done - three A0 posters (designed in LaTeX) and two conference proceedings articles submitted for LB11 in Sapporo. Trying to think if I have forgotten anything - can't take my tripod as it pushed my case 3 kg over the weight allowance <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/sad.png" alt=":-(" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I am taking my Nikon F80 and my little Sony Cybershot digital camera with me so I will hopefully get some great photos.<br />

Haven't heard from any of the Japanese Gentoo developers about meeting up in Tokyo. I have heard from a few who can't make it though - I will try to check emails whilst I am out there but that will be sporadic at best. Wish me luck! First big conference and first ever trip to Japan! I will be back in the UK in two weeks.
