I finshed my 10 km run in Graves Park today!!! I was really pleased with myself as I did the whole thing in just under 59 minutes, I didn't get any shin splints and I managed to raise Â£56.50 for the <a href="http://www.bhf.org.uk/">British Heart Foundation</a>. It was certainly very tough and there were some big hills on the course. It was mostly on grass too which seemed to take more out of me as I was running it.<br />
<br />
I was aiming to do it in under an hour though and I did that. I don't think I am super fit yet, and I haven't lost as much weight as I would like but it certainly made me feel good that I could make it round the course and come out with quite a good time. There were a few there that did it in 35-40 minutes I believe - I might get there one day! I would quite like to find a half marathon to run somewhere next!<br />

I am going to relax for the rest of the day working in front of my computer...
