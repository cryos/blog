<span><p>I am currently on a plane bound for Portland, Oregon enjoying the in-plane wi-fi. Will Schroeder, Brian Wylie and I will be talking about <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/19109">"Practicing Open Science"</a> on Friday in the government track. I am standing in for Bill Hoffman who unfortunately could not make it, and will be discussing the work I have been doing to grow open chemistry both at Kitware and outside of Kitware with many amazing collaborators scattered around the world. I am really excited to have the opportunity to talk at OSCON, and would be happy to meet up and discuss this work if you are at OSCON. Will and Brian are both very passionate about open science too, they will both give their unique perspectives on practicing open science. I will be there from this evening and don't fly out until early Saturday morning.</p>

<p>I am very much looking forward to OSCON, and the major difficulty I have had is choosing between the talks that are all happening at the same time. In some cases there are two or three I would like to see in any given slot. I am hoping to attend the KDE release party tomorrow too, please join us there if you would like to celebrate with us.</p></span>
