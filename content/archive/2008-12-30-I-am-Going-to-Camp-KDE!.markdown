<span><p>I just wanted to let anyone who has not spotted it already know that I am going to Camp KDE in January! I am really looking forward to it and hope to be able to talk with lots of developers and users. I will be giving half of the talk about KDE and Distros. Specifically Gentoo, but also adding my viewpoint as a downstream consumer of KDE.</p>

<p>I am not officially talking about Avogadro, Kalzium and all the work I have been doing there. Unfortunately there was not enough time in the schedule to fit that in too. I would be very happy to talk to people about it, and will have slides, videos and screenshots with me. So, if you are interested and we can find a corner of a room let me know!</p>

<p>I am registered, have flights and a room booked. So much to do - I did all that weeks ago but only just found time to announce it.</p></span>
