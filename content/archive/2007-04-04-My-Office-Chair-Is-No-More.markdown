<span><p>It would seem I have been working so hard on my thesis that my chair has given up the ghost and broke. I was pondering over some graphs in I was plotting for my thesis, lent back slightly and the plastic arm broke <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/sad.png" alt=":-(" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I am going to have to go out tomorrow and find a replacement as I am getting back ache and don't need any excuses not to work on my thesis <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>

<p>They just don't make things to last any more... In related news Nick convinced me to join <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. Despite writing my random ramblings for the world on my blog, and putting up random pictures in my <a href="http://gallery.cryos.net/">gallery</a> I have never really bothered taking part in any social networking sites. I will see how it goes but don't intend to let it distract me from my primary goal right now - finishing my thesis!</p></span>
