<span><p>It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/wiki/Avogadro_1.0.0">Avogadro 1.0.0</a>. After many years of work we have released what we consider to be a stable Avogadro release on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_Day">Mole Day</a>, which seems appropriate given the projects's name. There are still some rough edges, but I think this is a good release. With your help we can fix bugs in the release while working on new features in trunk.</p>

<p>What better time to look back to the beginnings of Avogadro. There was a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/community/avogadro-the-tyra-of-molecular-modeling/">blog post made today by Sourceforge about Avogadro</a> detailing a little of that history. I have also made a <a href="http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm/">code_swarm</a> movie visualizing the history of the <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net">Avogadro project</a>. There have been quite some changes in that time both at a project level and a personal level.</p>

<p>I would like to thank <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> for sponsoring me for a <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">GSoC project</a> in the summer of 2007. Also <a href="http://hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/">Geoff Hutchison</a> for giving me the opportunity to work with him at the University of Pittsburgh on interesting computational and visualization projects. Then there is my new employer, <a href="http://www.kitware.com/">Kitware</a>, who have provided me with an exciting opportunity to push scientific visualization and cross platform development to its limits.</p>

<p>To finish off a great day, my wife has informed me my new espresso machine has arrived! I am going to <a href="http://camp.kde.org/">Camp KDE</a> in January too!</span>
