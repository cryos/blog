Well I have booked my flights and hotel room, joined the American Physical Society and registered for their March meeting in Baltimore. I am feeling broke but really looking forward to seeing some of the American East coast (only ever been to California in the US). I am also looking forward to the jobs fair held in parallel to the conference. I will be polishing my CV and registering for the it pretty soon.<br />
<br />
Managed to arrange for my wife to join me after the conference so that we can look around the area and make a bit of a holiday out of it. This is going to be a tough year writing up my thesis, searching for jobs, finishing up my current research and getting it published. I am really looking forward to looking around Washington DC too as it looks like a really amazing place. Drop me a line if you are in the area and fancy meeting up for a beer one night or have any recommendations of sights we should taken in.
