With all the pressures of this year I decided that I would like to make some time to read for pleasure and had been meaning to read a discworld novel by Terry Pratchett for quite some time. Louise and I were in the city centre on Monday and I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=freebooktradestu&camp=1634&creative=6738&path=ASIN%2F0552152676%2Fqid%3D1145114362%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dsr_2_3_1">Thud!</a> on special offer at Waterstones and bought it. It is the first fiction book I have picked up and read in months - always seem to have my head buried in physics, nanotechnology, mathematics and programming books these days.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed it and found the book very entertaining. I don't know if it is one of the better books in the series or not, but I certainly think I will find the time to read a few more. I don't want to get too engrossed though as I need to write up my thesis this year <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />
