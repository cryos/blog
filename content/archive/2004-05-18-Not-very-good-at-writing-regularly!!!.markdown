I think I have managed to prove that I am not very good at writing a blog very frequently! I just get so busy, and stuff like this slips right to the bottom of the pile... Lots and lots has happened, most fairly good. Had the Hicks Ball, and that was pretty good - I think most people who attended had a nice time anyway.<br />
<br />
Just about all my friends are now finishing, and getting ready for their exams now. Alex has managed to get a PhD in my group which is nice. Had our last Thursday out last week, and I am having a BBQ on Saturday (if the weather holds) for everyone before their exams start.<br />
<br />
I have also built a new computer, and it is very nice. Built Matt one to a very similar spec too. AMD Athlon 64 3200+ with 1MB L2 cache. 1 GB Geil CAS2 memory, and a 128 MB nVidia FX5900XT graphics card, 74 GB Western Digital Raptor 10,000 rpm hard drive, a CD-RW/DVD combo drive and a very nice Antec case/PSU. Got some nice big 5.1 speakers for it yesterday too - running a little short on cash so I hope to buy a TFT when I next get paid may be.<br />
<br />
Anyway, really busy with work and need to get home early to try and finish my fence <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I will try to write more often, but it's so hard to discipline myself to do it...
