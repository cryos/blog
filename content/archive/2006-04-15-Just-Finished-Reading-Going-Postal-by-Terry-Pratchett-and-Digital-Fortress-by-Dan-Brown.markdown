On my recent trip to Baltimore I read my second Discworld novel - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=freebooktradestu&camp=1634&creative=6738&path=ASIN%2F0552149438">Going Postal</a>. I have to say that I enjoyed this book much more than Thud! It is a very clever book and it appealed to me on many levels. I especially enjoyed the Clacks and the parallels my mind drew with areas of modern life and some of the practices of the operators of the Clacks. Moist was a  fun character if not a little predictable, all in all a great read in my opinion.<br />
<br />
However Dan Brown's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=freebooktradestu&camp=1634&creative=6738&path=ASIN%2F0552151696">Digital Fortress</a> was a big disappointment to me. It was predictable and terminology was used in a clumsy and in some cases incorrect fashion. He made the common mistake of calling crackers hackers and tried to dramatise the breaking down of a firewall in a way that really did not work for me. If he really did consult with ex-NSA agents I fear for the security of the NSA! I thought it might be a fun read but it really wasn't. I may yet read the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=freebooktradestu&camp=1634&creative=6738&path=ASIN%2F0552149519">Da Vinci Code</a> but after reading this book I am in  no rush to get it.<br />
<br />
So a bit of a mixed bag. I found Dan Brown's writing pretty simplistic with silly amounts of twists at then end that were almost funny but not really. Whereas Going Postal was a really fun book that had me amused all the way though. I have bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=freebooktradestu&camp=1634&creative=6738&path=ASIN%2F0413774449">Night Watch</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=freebooktradestu&camp=1634&creative=6738&path=ASIN%2F0552154261">Thief of Time</a> by Terry Pratchett - both were recommended by friends.<br />
<br />
I also bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=freebooktradestu&camp=1634&creative=6738&path=ASIN%2F0954519922">The Art of Diving</a> on a friends recommendation as his friend Alex Mustard did all the photography. I have to say the photos are amazing and I can only hope to take pictures approaching that quality whilst I am in Malta. I also bought An Essential Guide to Underwater Photography by Michael Aw and Matthieu Meur when I was at the London Internation Dive Show (Amazon doesn't seem to have this) and got it signed by the author (first book I have ever had signed). Hopefully that will help me to take some nice pictures - I tested out my underwater camera enclosure and strobe yesterday ready for the holiday <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />
