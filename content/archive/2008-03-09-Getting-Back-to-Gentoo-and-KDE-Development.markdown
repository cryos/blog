<span><p>After I got back from the UK in January my wife came to join me. She brought with her my old Acer Ferrari nearly working shy of a new hard drive. I got one from NewEgg at a fairly reasonable price and installed it. The drive arrived with a few bent pins, packaging isn't their strong point obviously, and took twice as long as they said but hey at least I had it. I had been stranded in America without Linux for more than three months and so another few days wasn't going to kill me.</p>

<p>Once I got the drive in it seemed the slot loading CD drive and got itself in a twist and would not load any CDs. An hour later and lots of pieces on the table I had reset it, put it back together (a few times) and got a Gentoo LiveCD in there. So I was in business. I had considered installing kubuntu but I wasn't getting on with it in the VM I had at work and I wanted to get back to Gentoo development too.</p>

<p>Everything looked good. Got an X server up and running. The ATI binary blob was as unstable as ever. Thanks to nerdboy (I think) I got the open source r300 driver working. This is much more stable although missing several OpenGL features we use in Avogadro such as smooth triangle shading, changing vertex colours in drawing operations etc. Other than that it works much better than the binary blob and is far more stable. I like stability in a system.</p>

<p>I have KDE 4 trunk running and am using it as my main desktop right now. Still got some rough edges I haven't had time to figure out just yet such as kmail refusing to save my IMAP accounts, kopete refusing to connect to GTalk and general saving issues most of the core seems pretty solid. I am compiling Thunderbird right now so that I have something. I will hopefully be getting back to Kalzium development pretty soon. If I find the time I would love to help out with KDE in a more general sense as well as helping out with the Gentoo packages.</p>

<p>My desktop is apparently in a customs area somewhere in New York. Delay after delay after delay with the shipping of my household possessions from the UK. So I am still without desktop hoping that an "intensive exam" is not too expensive and does not involve breaking any of my stuff :/ We shall see. Fingers crossed I will actually have furniture and my desktop computer back within a few weeks. That would allow me to be so much more productive having my dual core Gentoo desktop back, creature comforts and all that good stuff.</p>

<p> So keep your fingers crossed for me. Hopefully you will be seeing a lot more commits coming from me in the KDE and Gentoo repositories as well as the Avogadro work I have managed to continue to do on the MacBook Geoff so kindly loaned me whilst I was laptopless (is that a word? It should be!) Not sure that was a sentence now either...</p></span>
