Well I got my bill on Thursday from Orange. They haven't refunded anything to my account and they have charged me again for the internet access products I never asked for! I am frankly amazed. I spent over 30 minutes on hold on Thursday night before hanging up and have been on hold for 33 minutes and counting as I write this post. The only redeeming thing is that the call doesn't cost me anything but I really don't have the time to sit around on hold like this. Surely I can't be the only person in the UK getting service like this?<br />
<br />
I signed up for a 12 month contract at &pound;30 a month and with these charges they decided to add on top it is costing just under &pound;40 a month before you add any extra calls over my allowance. I think that would count as false advertising at the very least so I think I will also contact my local trading standards office. Not sure if I will actually get through to the call centre, and even if I do I am not sure if I will get to talk to anyone more effective than the poor excuse for a customer service agent I spoke to last month. On hold for 36 minutes now.<br />
<br />
I really should be writing up my thesis but find it hard to do that with this terrible hold music in my ear and the "We are currently experiencing a very high number of calls..." message in my ear. Are they ever not currently receiving a very high number of calls? After 37 minutes I got through to a very nice lady who said nothing had been done on my account last month and no notes or anything had been made about my call.<br />
<br />
She did however say that she would get the items removed, and that she would refund the amount the other lady said she would and even sent me a text confirming this in writing. Hopefully she has done what she said, she was a lot more polite, I could understand her (I think a slight Scottish tinge to her accent) and I can stop ranting on about how terrible Orange are being! Still 37 minutes on hold is pretty damn poor no matter how nice the staff are.<br />
<br />
Back to writing my thesis.
