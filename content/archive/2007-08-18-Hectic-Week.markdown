<span><p>Wow - what a hectic week. This has got to have been one of the most exhausting weeks I have had in years. Started off with final corrections and tweaking of my doctoral thesis. After many hours of printing I got the three copies submitted on Tuesday afternoon. Managed a few celebrations on Wednesday evening along with a friend who submitted her thesis on Wednesday. Thursday we went to a friend's wedding which was really nice.</p>

<p>Yesterday we had a really long day, we caught a train at just after 7am down to London. We weren't allowed to take any electronics as we were going to the US embassy to apply for a visa. I really missed having my mobile phone and being in London it would have been good to have had a camera. We got to the embassy in good time, spent about three hours in there before having our applications approved, which means we can finally start making travel arrangements! I start my new job in Pittsburgh at the start of October and am really looking forward to getting out there. I am sure I will talk more about my postdoctoral position more soon! We didn't get back home until just after midnight, by which pointy we were very tired.</p>

<p>Now we are on Saturday and I can finally sit down in front of a computer. I am surrounded by electronics again and so am much happier now <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I don't think people appreciate how hard it is for someone like me to be without electronics for a day. I am now surveying what I can get done for my Google Summer of Code project before it ends. I will blog shortly about some of the stuff I have done recently but just haven't found the time to talk about yet too.</p></span>
