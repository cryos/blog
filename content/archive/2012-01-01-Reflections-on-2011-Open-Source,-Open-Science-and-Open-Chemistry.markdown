<span><p>It has been so long since I uttered a word here, 2011 was certainly a busy year for me and I hope to ensure I dedicate more time telling people about what I am up to in 2012. In preparation for that I have spent some time moving my blog to some new hardware, in the cloud. I also got to the bottom of the poor performance of page loads, and things should be much snappier now. After all that I figured it was time for a cosmetic refresh, so after upgrading the Serendipity I selected a new and hopefully cleaner theme.</p>

<p>As an extra special treat I updated the photo to something a little more recent to - me emerging from my TARDIS with a mug of espresso in hand! <a href="http://www.kitware.com/">Kitware</a> grew a lot last year, so much so that we had to take space in a new building across the road. It was decided that our scientific computing team would move, along with the communications team. <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/163">In the move</a> I got my own office, with a view of the old office across the street.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a> was <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/104">accepted as a mentoring organization</a> in the Google Summer of Code program. We were lucky enough to get two very talented and tenacious students who <a href="http://www.kitware.com/source/home/post/44">produced some great work over the summer</a>. We also continued improving and extending <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/70">Gerrit</a>, and thanks to the Google Summer of Code I had the opportunity to attend both the <a href="http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/2011">Mentor Summit</a> and the <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/12/gittogether-2011.html">Git Together</a> (held the day after). Not satisfied with two meetings in one trip I also attended a small portion of the <a href="http://opensciencesummit.com/">Open Science Summit</a>, and hope to be able to attend the whole thing if it happens again in 2012.</p>

<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.openscience.org/blog/?p=269">Open Science</a>, 2011 was a big year for the area both on a personal level and in the wider community. I <a href="http://blog.cryos.net/archives/254-Conferences-Talking-Open-Science-at-OSCON,-Desktop-Summit-and-Chemical-Databases-Meeting.html">talked about our work in open science at several conferences</a>, and more specifically the work we have been doing in Open Chemistry. I wrote a Source article introducing the <a href="http://www.kitware.com/source/home/post/39">work that we have done in Open Chemistry since I joined Kitware</a>, and we recently acquired the <a href="http://openchemistry.org/">openchemistry.org</a> domain and have begun populating it. We were also awarded a Phase II SBIR which gives us two years of funding to develop many of the applications and libraries that I mentioned in the article.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/">Science Code Manifesto</a> was conceived in 2011, and Michael Nielsen released his new book <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/reinventing-discovery/">Reinventing Discovery</a>. There was also <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a> which highlighted the need for open access to scientific journals and data. I was very pleased to be a coauthor on two open access articles in 2011, <a href="http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/38">the Quixote project</a> and <a href="http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/37">the Blue Obelisk five years on</a>. I was also honored to receive my own <a href="http://blog.cryos.net/archives/250-Blue-Obelisk-Award.html">Blue Obelisk award in 2011 from Peter Murrary-Rust</a>!</p>

<p>There is so much else, but I am out of time for now and this post is already very long. <a href="http://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> was released to the masses, you <a href="https://plus.google.com/113975743934359964892">can see a little more of me there</a>, and I have created an <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/114547712877150296237/">Open Chemistry page</a> that I will try to keep updated over the coming year. I was invited to a workshop on <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/12/12/workshop-and-symposium-on-semantic-physical-science/">Semantic Physical Science</a> in Cambridge, England and so I will be starting my traveling very much earlier than usual - leaving next Thursday. Here is to a great new year, one in which I hope we as a community can make significant progress in opening science for the world, and creating a truly shared set of tools for all!</p>

<p>I hope that 2012 is the year more of us start sharing in meaningful ways.</p></span>
