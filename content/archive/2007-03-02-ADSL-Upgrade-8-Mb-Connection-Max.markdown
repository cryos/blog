<span><p>I have been so busy recently I missed the introduction of a new ADSL product that connects you at up to 8 Mb/s downstream and up to 448 kb/s upstream depending upon noise levels. Before this I have been on a standard 1 Mb/s connection with a 256 kb/s upstream so it is quite an upgrade.</p>

<p>It is actually a little cheaper too, but this upgrade does come at a price. My transfer used to be unlimited, they had just introduced a cap of 100 GB, and the new service I am on is capped at 20 GB a month... It seems in the last ten months I haven't used more than 11 GB so I should be OK with the new limit.</p>

<p>It does mean I will have to keep an eye on it, especially when using torrents and stuff. It seems that this is the way the UK broadband scene is moving now. I can upgrade to a package with 50 GB of transfer but that is another &pound;10 a month. I still have 1 TB of transfer a month on my server too which I never get anywhere near at present - I will have to start trying harder!</p>

<p>Currently it is synced at 5792 kbps downstream and 448 kbps upstream. The highest sustained rates I have achieved are 248 KB/s downstream and 44 KB/s upstream. This is with <a href="http://www.zen.co.uk/">Zen Internet</a> who I have been using for over three years now I think on their Zen 8000 Active service. Not bad in my opinion although I would love one of those funky new ADSL2 connections.</p>

<p>I recently purchased a <a href="http://www.zyxel.com/web/product_family_detail.php?PC1indexflag=20040812093058&CategoryGroupNo=AC5783AE-9475-41AD-BDA5-0997187F44AA">ZyXEL 660HW-T1 wireless ADSL router</a> that came with a free <a href="http://www.zyxel.com/web/product_family_detail.php?PC1indexflag=20040520161256&CategoryGroupNo=67F17733-1AD6-4EB6-BCA2-11B4CDDBC1E2">USB wireless adapter</a> too. The router supports ADSL2 but best of all it supports SNMP properly, unlike my old <a href="http://www.draytek.com/">DrayTek Vigor 2600</a> that they never fixed. That can be my backup router now. With <a href="http://www.reactivated.net/weblog/>dsd's</a> help I even got the wireless adapter working, although it may not get up to full speed. Need to test further on the weekend.</p></span>
