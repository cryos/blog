After <a href="http://wonkabar.org/blog/?p=107">Steve Dibb's</a> post about hackergotchis I figured I would have another crack at making one... Tried Krita but couldn't figure out how to get it to feather the selection, moved over to Gimp and I did better but the cut out isn't exactly smooth and the drop shadow went around the whole image, not just my face. I also couldn't quite figure out how hackergotchis handle long hair? May be I should try and dig out a picture where I had my hair tied back instead to make it easier!<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to have a play I would appreciate it - or just give me some further pointers. I have put a few pictures below, there are more scattered in my online <a href="http://gallery.cryos.net/">gallery</a> too. Finish off my rescue diver course tomorrow too - all day out at <a href="http://www.dive-site.co.uk/">Capernwray</a> doing exercises and scenarios! Hopefully we will manage to squeeze a dive in after the course too...<br />
