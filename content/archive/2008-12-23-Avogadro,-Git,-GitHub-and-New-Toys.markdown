<span><p>I have been using <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> and <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html">Git SVN</a> for quite some time now. It took me a little while to get into Git and see what all the fuss with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a> was about. Now I find myself enjoying using Git more and more when it is the only version control in use in a project.</p>

<p>Git SVN is certainly a great compatibility layer, and it has allowed me to use Git as my version control system locally without requiring that the projects I contribute to switch. I had heard lots of good things about <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, but had not found the time to check it out until <a href="http://geoffhutchison.net/blog/">Geoff</a> showed me Avogadro after he had pushed it to GitHub. There are some great stats and it looks like is has some great features. I was originally put off by the 100MB limit on storage as it seemed a little low.</p>

<p>When I got home yesterday evening I started playing with it and ultimately made three <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/">Avogadro</a> repositories - the third one looks like it is the charm. I had not been worried about importing author metadata previously as I had just been using it locally, but after reading this <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/05/cleanly-migrate-your-subversion-repository-to-a-git-repository/">short guide to migrating to Git</a> I had all the tools I needed. A short trawl through our mailing lists, web pages and history to update author information and I had <a href="http://github.com/cryos/avogadro/">a shiny new Avogadro git repository</a>.</p>

<p>I am still getting the hang of how all this works. I have added several other committers it matched up as collaborators, but did not spot what exactly that means yet. I was able to get CIA working in our IRC channel, pushed some changes and even synced up a commit from this morning. So I think all is well and I will likely keep this repo up to date with our development. It only has trunk in it, but shows <a href="http://github.com/cryos/avogadro/commits/master">photos of your friendly Avogadro developers</a> and a really nice <a href="http://github.com/cryos/avogadro/graphs/impact">visualisation of development over time</a>. I think it should open up with the latest stats first, but other that that am impressed. It complements some of the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/avogadro/">ohloh analysis</a> quite nicely too.</p>

<p>Now can we all please move our source over to some kind of Git repository please!</p></span>
