<span><p>This is a little belated as the weekend was hectic but I want to wish GNU a happy 25th birthday too! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fry">Stephen Fry</a> made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcErY4ne5Yw">video</a> to wish GNU a happy 25th birthday which I really enjoyed. I may be biased as an English man and a big fan...</p>

<p>I think he did a great job of describing open source in a very approachable way for those of us who are less geeky. You can also <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fry/happy-birthday-to-gnu-download.html">download a higher quality video</a>. I miss <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI">QI</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon">thick-cut back bacon</a>! Neither of which seem to be available over here. Enjoy the video and think of us English people living in a foreign land <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></span>
