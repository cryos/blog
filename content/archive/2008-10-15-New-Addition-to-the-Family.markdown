<span><p>On Monday we had a new addition to the family arrive - an Asus Eee PC 1000! So far I am pretty impressed with the hardware. The Linux installation was pretty disappointing but I never really intended to keep that anyway. I played around with it on Monday as I built a chroot for the new arrival (pictured below).</p>

<p>I went for the 10" model as I was worried about the size of the keyboard on the smaller ones. I also liked the sound of the SSD drive and it looked like a great little unit. I ended up building a custom stage 4 Gentoo tarball for it on my desktop and installing it here. I have it running the new KDE 4.1.2 ebuilds along with a few KDE 3 apps I can't do without.</p>

<p>All in all it seems to be working pretty well. I only got round to installing Gentoo on it yesterday. So far I have the webcam, wired and wireless networking working. I am using <a href="http://wicd.sourceforge.net/">WICD</a> to control networking. I would love to see a Qt4/KDE 4 frontend that integrates better but it is an awesome little app.</p>

<p>This is my first post on it, the screen isn't a bad size and the battery life seems to be good. I am on the road today and my wife acted as an unwilling hand model. I still haven't managed to get the asus_laptop or asus_acpi modules to load and so am missing all those devices. It claims no such device.</p>

<p>I will hopefully be able to post more at some point in the future. I certainly think this is great for being on the road and Skype is working with the webcam. I did use the 2.6.27 kernel whicih made things a lot easier I suspect. I might try building a vanilla kernel soon to see if that lets me insert  the asus_laptop module successfully.</p>

<p>For now I have quite a few hours to kill in the BA lounge at JFK!</p></span>
