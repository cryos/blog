Hard as it might be to believe it just goes on with these guys. I got an email from some person informing me I wouldn't be getting a refund as they didn't offer one on the root servers! I phoned up a little angry about this, and point the guy to their web site. After being on hold for about ten minutes the person informs me that they do offer refunds and said he would refund my money right then.<br />
<br />
He then went back on this and said the system wouldn't let him refund until 4 April. I protested, but as it wasn't too far away I unwillingly agreed to wait until then. On the 8 April after another phone call they sent me an invoice saying they were refunding Â£18.92 of the Â£197.41 I paid them! I found this quite unbelievable and mentioned again that I would be contacting my credit card company about this and expected a full refund as offered clearly on their web site.<br />
<br />
On 13 April they sent me another invoice saying they would refund me Â£116.33 to me. I have since sent yet another email saying that they have still missed Â£62.16, and I expected all of it back. I have had all I can take as it is nearly a month later. I have sent them a courtesy email but I will be talking to my credit card company about recovering the money. I still haven't seen a penny back from them.<br />
<br />
What got it for me was the guy on the phone right at the start, who felt the need to say "We are a legitimate company". What more can I say, I seriously have my doubts that you are and would certainly never touch 1&1. I wish I had never gone near them, but I thought they must be OK having been voted 2nd best hosting provider in the Linux Format Awards. I do not think any company should be allowed to treat its customers so badly.<br />
<br />
I still need to sort out a dedicated server once all this is over with too...
