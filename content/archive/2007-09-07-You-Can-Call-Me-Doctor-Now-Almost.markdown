<span><p>Yesterday was the day of my viva (or viva voce in full). It is one of the reasons I have been so quiet recently - preparing for it. I am pleased to announce that it went really well and I passed. There is some paperwork and stuff I need to take care of but I am now a doctor (well, almost <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> ). I did go out for a few drinks for most of yesterday evening with friends to celebrate which was great.</p></span>
