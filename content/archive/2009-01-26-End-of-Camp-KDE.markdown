<span><p>Camp KDE is over now, I managed to squeeze in a couple of dives before leaving. Our trip back was quite uneventful, the free wireless in Charlotte was nice, and a friend very kindly picked us up from the airport. We got back to a snow covered Pittsburgh yesterday evening. It was good to be back home but the cold weather was quite a shock to the system. I think that Camp KDE was a great success, and thoroughly enjoyed meeting everyone there, and learning a lot from Till and the other Trolls (do they need renaming now?).</p>

<p>It is my birthday today, scarily the next one is the big 30! There were quite a few birthdays in and around the Camp KDE period. I got into work to discover our espresso machine died while I was away - hopefully this will not impact productivity too much... Looks like I have a really busy month ahead of me but will likely take some time out this evening to have a small celebration.</p>

<p>Big KDE 4.2 release tomorrow too - the RC has been working great on my Eee PC while I was away at Camp KDE. The new laptop features are working great and sleep seems to be working flawlessly. I think that 4.2 will be a great release, and on a personal level find that it is now very usable on a day to day basis. I hope Jos and Sebas make it back OK - I think they are the last Camp KDE attendees to leave Jamaica.</p></span>
