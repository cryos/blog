Just about to set off to catch the train down to London. Looking forward to meeting lots of developers and users at the UK Linux Expo. Shame I can't afford to attend any of the talks, but it should be good fun anyway. I think there is a Lonix social event on Wednesday night too. Must dash or I will miss my train!
