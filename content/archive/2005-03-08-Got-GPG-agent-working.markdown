After some pointers from tove to documentation <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gnupg-user.xml#doc_chap4">here</a> I got gpg-agent set up and working. I have only tried using the Qt pinentry client so command line may still present some challenges - but it does seem to work well in the KDE environment. It should really help in completing the ~amd64 keywording of all those KDE split ebuilds! Some day they will all need stabilising too...
