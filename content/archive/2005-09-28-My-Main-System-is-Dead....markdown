As the title says my main system is dead. I was working on it earlier, went to get some dinner and came back later to find it powered down. Hit the power button and it never POSTed <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/sad.png" alt=":-(" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> Stripped it down sequentially until I was left with just the CPU plugged into the main board and I still don't even get any beeps! It is a Gigabyte GA-K8NS Pro motherboard and has never been quite right so I am tempted to think it is that, but there is also the possibility of graphics, RAM and CPU issues.<br />
<br />
Until I get some cash and figure out what went I won't be doing much development as that box housed all of my work including Gentoo CVS repos, experimental ebuilds and such. I think the hard drive is intact but don't have any other SATA systems. Pretty sure I also have a DVD backup from about a month or so ago, but my first priority is to get the system working again. If anyone feels like sharing any tips with me on diagnosing my system I would welcome them. It has been a crappy week - at least I have my new laptop so I can still get some work done. Most of my data and SVN repos are on that box too though <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/sad.png" alt=":-(" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /><br />
<br />
<b>Update:</b> It does seem to be the time for system problems with quite a few devs having trouble with their systems in the last few months. Checking on my mainboard (pretty sure it is that - hunch though) it is three weeks out of warranty. Not a good week at all - can't get anything done until I get my system working again...
