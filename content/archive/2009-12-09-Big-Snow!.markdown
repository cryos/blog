<span><p>As some of you may remember we moved up to Clifton Park, NY in September. From when I first met Bill at Camp KDE in January he told me about all the snow they got up here. To be honest I was starting to doubt him, and then we got some snow on the weekend and I was really excited. Today I woke up, looked out and saw we got a lot of snow! I am not disappointed, possibly a little overwhelmed...</p>

<p>I think I am going to like it up here, Dax loves it and William is not too sure what to make of it right now. They just plowed the road (not our big drive though), and so I may try to venture into work soon. Of course Dax and I had a big play in the snow, and I think we are going to have to buy a sledge as soon as possible.</p></span>
