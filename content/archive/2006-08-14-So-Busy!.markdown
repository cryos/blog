I am so busy at the moment! Went diving yesterday at Stoney Cove to do my deep specialty - it was really good to get away from it for a day. I have been doing data analysis all day today, and I was hoping to get more of my thesis written but so far haven't had time to get to that today. I haven't had much time for Gentoo development at all recently - hopefully things will improve a little once I have made some progress with my thesis write up. I can't believe it is mid-August already!!!<br />

Back to the grind stone...
