Well it has been a great week in Sapporo, Japan. The hotel is beautiful and the conference has been very productive. My three posters seemed to be well received and Tim's talk went well. I have tried lots of Japanese food - no sushi yet though. The food at the hotel is great and we have had some really great meals in Sapporo, although I didn't always know what I was eating!<br />
<br />
The farewell party is a little later this evening, and we fly to Tokyo tomorrow where we have a week to explore and take in as much as we can before going home. I really wish I could remember the name of more of the foods we have tried. We went to a traditional spa which was very relaxing. I will hopefully write more of this down after I get home - I do have some great photos too - I just hope they all come out.
