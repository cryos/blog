<span><p>Just to add that I think this is absolutely amazing news - <a href="http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2009/01/14/nokia-to-license-qt-under-lgpl/">Qt is going to add LGPL licensing</a> as an option. For the few situations I have questioned using the Qt library it has mainly been an issue of license. I think this is huge news and now cannot see any downsides to using Qt when working on C++ GUI applications and libraries.</p>

<p>Thanks - I can't wait to thank some of you in person at <a href="http://camp.kde.org/">Camp KDE</a>!</p></span>
