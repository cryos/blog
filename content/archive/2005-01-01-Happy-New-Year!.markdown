Well it's another year - I hope you have all made your new year's resolutions <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I haven't, as I thought I would skip the superfluous steps of making and breaking them... It's been a long year, and not all that great in many spots. Hopefully this year will go better.<br />
<br />
I was recently made a Gentoo developer, so I am really hoping to add something to Gentoo in the area of scientific and mathematical applications as well as improving AMD Athlon 64 support. It is a great distribution and my first official involvement in an open source project.<br />
<br />
I also want to thank Poland for stopping ePatents. I don't know if they will succeed but it is certainly a very courageous act that the British government didn't even get close to making. Speaking of government I need to file my tax return by the end of January too <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/sad.png" alt=":-(" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />
