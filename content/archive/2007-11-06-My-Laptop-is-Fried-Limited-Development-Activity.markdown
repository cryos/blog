<span><p>Since moving out to Pittsburgh I have been using my Acer Ferrari laptop at home for development, keeping in touch with people back home and trying to figure out some of the weirder rules out here such as driving licenses in this state. Last night I booted up when I got home and after logging in everything went a little funky - got I/O errors when typing ls for example.</p>

<p>I tried rebooting but it wouldn't even get to the GRUB prompt. So I got out an old Gentoo LiveCD which I had luckily left in my laptop bag. That got so far then failed to mount the drive. After a few reboots and a little wine (to calm my nerves <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> ) I managed to access the drive. I thought I would try copying some stuff across to my external hard drive and ended up getting more I/O errors and some memory errors for good measure. Half the time when I booted from the LiveCD the kernel panicked when attempting to mount the hard drive partitions.</p>

<p>So today I am a very unhappy English man in Pittsburgh. Due to me having spent far more than I budgeted for moving out here, and then more again on flying my dog out, I don't foresee being able to replace it any time soon. This means my development activity will be limited. Not sure if compiling part of a KDE 4 checkout might have been what finished it off. Looks like some kind of motherboard issue. The trackpad stopped working months ago, now I am getting random memory and I/O errors and the CPU has been running hotter and hotter recently. It served me for just over two years which isn't great but I worked it pretty hard and it travelled a fair part of the globe with me too.</p>

<p>Still can't help being cheered up a little as I will be picking Dax, my overgrown German Shepherd dog up from Dulles Washington International Airport tomorrow (not Dallas as it sounded like on the message they left me which made me very unhappy when I first heard).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> My very nice and generous new boss has very kindly offered to let me use the group laptop in the interim. It is a MacBook Pro though using something called Mac OS X Leopard. I can keep hacking on Avogadro with it and I even know how to take screen shots with it now too! It is also capable of checking email and browsing the web so my Internet connection in the apartment won't go to waste. I am considerably happier now but will miss my KDE 4 and Linux fix <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></span>
