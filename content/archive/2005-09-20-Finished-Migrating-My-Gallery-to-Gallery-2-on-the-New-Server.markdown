I have finished moving my old Gallery 1 site from my old server to the new one, and took the opportunity to migrate over to the newly released <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery 2</a>. Everything seemed to work really well and the migration went across without too many issues. I had been testing the betas and rcs anyway, but it was great to see the final product. I think <a href="http://gallery.cryos.net/">my gallery</a> looks much better now. I did see another Gallery 2 site with the year as a big heading, and the albums taken in that year in that section which I really liked.<br />
<br />
Anyway I am really busy and am going to have to shoot. I took the opportunity to add all the photos from my trip to Japan, stag week in Tenerife, our wedding and some of the honeymoon photos. Hopefully I will get time to add more later. I am very impressed overall, but I would really like the photos in the random photo and when you are looking at individual photos to be centred. I will have to see if there is an easy way to do that soon.
