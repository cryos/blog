<span><p>On Wednesday Dax, my overgrown German Shepherd dog, took his first ever flight. Originally they were supposed to fly him into Pittsburgh International Airport but apparently there were no carriers that could accommodate such an overgrown dog!</p>

<p>So eventually they gave up and told us that they couldn't get him to Pittsburgh as promised. I think it was Thursday night last week I had a voice mail left from what sounded like Dallas International Airport asking me to call them back and confirm that I would take delivery of Dax. I nearly had kittens of my own as I saw how far away this was!</p>

<p>It turned out that there is a Dulles International Airport, and the way it is pronounced sounds very much like Dallas. That was a much more manageable four hour drive away near Washington DC. So I hired a large pickup truck for Wednesday of this week.</p></span> <br /><a href="http://blog.cryos.net/archives/164-Daxs-Flight-to-the-US.html#extended">Continue reading "Dax's Flight to the US"</a>
