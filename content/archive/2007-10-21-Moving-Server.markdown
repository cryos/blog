<span><p>As I moved continent I guess it is only right I move servers too <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I have spent most of the weekend backing up, transferring and restoring email, web sites and other assorted services over to a different server I will be sharing access to. Thankfully it is still a Gentoo Linux based server that I will be sharing with my brother-in-law.</p>

<p>The move has taken a lot longer than I anticipated but I think everything is over now. Still some cleaning up tasks to perform. Hopefully this blog hasn't been kicked off planets or spammed them during the move over. If you notice any problems with anything feel free to poke me. Hoping I have finished moving for quite some time now - it isn't much fun and reduces productivity...</p></span>
