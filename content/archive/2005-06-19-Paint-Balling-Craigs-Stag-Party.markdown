Well I went paint balling for the first time ever yesterday. It was for a friends stag party, and I have to admit I had mixed feelings about it... All in all we had a pretty good day, and accumulated quite a range of injuries between us <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I have quite a few bruises from the paint balls - they really do hurt when they hit you! It was certainly an experience, although I don't think I will be doing it again any time soon.<br />
<br />
Covered head to toe in a boiler suit, head protection and massive goggles on a hot summers day. Dripping with sweat and dehydrated after running round in it all day, covered in bruises and comparing battle wounds. We all went down to the dog track afterwards - after a good long shower and a couple of beers. Now that was more my speed - came up about even on my high stakes Â£1 bets! Back to work today after the hangover and suit fittings today at Meadowhall.<br />
<br />
Just hope I get enough done before we leave for Japan on Friday.
