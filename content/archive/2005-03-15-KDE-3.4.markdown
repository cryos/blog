I have been testing KDE 3.4 on the amd64 platform since beta 1 was released, and started work several weeks ago on testing and keywording the split ebuilds shortly after rc1 was released. It has been a lot of work, with more than 300 ebuilds marked I think. Overall there have been very few issues with it, and I really do think it is a big improvement. I have included a screenshot I took a couple of days ago showing my KDE 3.4 rc1 desktop.<br />

The only crasher I have discovered is kasteroids - it segfaults on any key press. I have made a patch that works for me, and have put it in our bugzilla and upstreams awaiting review. I have marked all kde-meta dependencies apart from kasteroids and kdegames-meta as ~amd64 in time for release day. Hopefully kasteroids will be ready soon after as it seems a fairly simple bug.<br />
<br />
So please test out KDE 3.4 on amd64, give me some feedback and most important of all enjoy it! A big thanks goes out to Dan Armak too for all the work he has put into making the split ebuilds happen.
