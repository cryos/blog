<span><p>Life has been so hectic since I moved to upstate New York to start my new job with <a href="http://www.kitware.com/">Kitware</a>. I am very pleased to say that Kitware is sending me to <a href="http://camp.kde.org/">Camp KDE 2010</a> in San Diego, CA 15-22 January. I will be presenting a talk on <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>, the new features in the recently released 2.8 version, and some of the less well known features of the CMake package, including CTest, and <a href="http://www.cdash.org/">CDash</a>. In addition I will be running a CMake training session for anyone who would like to learn more about CMake.</a>

<p>I attended the first Camp KDE last year in Jamaica, and am very pleased to be attending the second Camp KDE next year in San Diego. Last year I focused on my work in packaging and open source chemistry visualization. I also met Bill Hoffman, who talked about CMake and am now working with him and many other talented people at Kitware. My wife and unborn child also attended the first Camp KDE. Now we have a six month old in the 97th percentile for length, weight and head size who will be joining my wife and I at Camp KDE 2010. I am trying to teach him to count from zero so that he has a good head start when he starts coding <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>

<p>I won't be talking about any of my work in open source scientific visualization at Camp KDE this time, but if any of the attendees are interested I would love to discuss it and will have a few slides for a short impromptu talk...</p></span><br />
