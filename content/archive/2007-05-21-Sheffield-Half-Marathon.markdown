<span><p>Yesterday I completed my first half marathon. I took part in the <a href="http://www.sheffieldmarathon.com/">Sheffield Half Marathon</a>. Due to lots of different reasons my training leading up to the half marathon did not go at all to plan. I think I only managed to get in three or four decent runs in the six weeks leading up to the event and had considered pulling out.</p>

<p>It was really tough and I ended up coming in at just under 2:30 which was a little disappointing. I am glad I did it, aching quite a bit and can't wait to get back into training and try for a better time at some point in the future. Quite a few friends also competed and it was an amazing atmosphere to run with a course that had somewhere in the region of 5000 competitors.</p></span>
