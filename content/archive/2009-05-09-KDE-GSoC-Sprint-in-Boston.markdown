<span><p>We all arrived yesterday in Boston, got to know each other and did some hacking. Yesterday evening we all went to an iMax theater to see the new Star Trek movie. We have spent most of the day talking code and hacking in a small room in one of MIT's buildings.</p>

<p>It has been a pretty productive day, and it is always great to meet up with KDE developers old and new. Everyone is heading out at various points throughout tomorrow. Thanks to Jeff and Qt Software for making this event happen.</p></span>
