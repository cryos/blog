Just given my talk (on my birthday no less) and I won joint first prize for it, so I am really pleased. I wrote it all in Linux using Kile, LaTeX and LaTeX beamer. You can look at a copy of the PDF <a href="http://blog.cryos.net/uploads/20060126-MDHanwell-AuNanoparticleTalk.pdf">here</a> if you would like to. It is a summary of two of the main areas of my research - alkanethiol encapsulated gold nanoparticle Langmuir-Blodgett/Langmuir-Schaeffer multilayers, and the sensing/conductivity characteristics of these multilayers to various gases and vapours.<br />
<br />
I just have to get more of my work published, write up my thesis, find a postdoctoral position (hopefully in the States or Canada) and pass my viva! Shouldn't be too hard, for now I am going to take the evening off and enjoy the rest of my 26th birthday <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />
