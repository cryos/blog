<span><p>A week or two ago Stuart (work colleague) and I entered the <a href="http://www.7thdronfield10k.org.uk/">Dronfield 10K</a> and no Sunday I ran it. For the first 4 km it was going pretty well and I was keeping to a fairly good pace of about 5 minutes to 5.5 minutes a km. Then came a really big hill that took a lot out of me, after that came some gradual hills that seemed to go on forever and by the 5 km mark I was ready to give up and had a massive stitch that I just couldn't shift.</p>

<p>I hadn't seen Stuart since the first kilometre, he was off in front somewhere. I seriously thought about pulling out as I hit 6 km and went past the start line and on to the second lap. Somehow I managed to keep going an convinced myself that I could do it. All the way round I was thinking I really need to train harder and more consistently if I am going to complete the <a href="http://www.sheffieldmarathon.com/">Sheffield Half Marathon</a> this year.</p>

<p>I was pleased I made it round but disappointed in my time which was a little over an hour. Too much time in front of a computer drinking coffee and not enough in the gym or hitting the pavement! I also need to stop letting so much junk food creep back into my diet, which is really easy to do when I am so stressed with completing my thesis...</p>

<p>Anyway I am glad I finished it, but I really want to get leaner and fitter before the half marathon. Stuart got a really good time I think and he was really pleased with himself. My muscles are still aching today but I am sure I will be back out running by Wedesday and am already looking for another race to push me on.</p>

<p>For now it is back to the thesis...</p></span>
