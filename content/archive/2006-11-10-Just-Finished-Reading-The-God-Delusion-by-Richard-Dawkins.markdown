I recently bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0593055489?ie=UTF8&tag=freebooktradestu&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0593055489">The God Delusion</a> by Richard Dawkins and couldn't put it down. I attended a Roman Catholic primary and secondary school and learnt quite a lot about religion. The more I learnt the less I believed, I think I was about 13 or 14 when I realised I was an atheist after spending quite some time reading the available literature and talking with some of my teachers, friends and family. I have been in situations where it has been difficult to discuss my beliefs and have had several people try to intimidate me over the years, as well as the odd attempt a "saving me"...<br />
<br />
I have to say that this book is very well written, and I recognised so many of the arguments used by religious people as well as many of Richard Dawkins' very well thought out responses as I have had similar discussions over the years. I really think it would do many people a great deal of good to read this whatever their particular theological stance. To me it was extremely refreshing to read such an honest and well thought out book that looks at every major argument used by religious people in turn and respond to it. This book will certainly be taking pride of place on my book shelf and after reading it I have been convinced that I really should be more outspoken about my own particular stance.<br />
<br />
There is a <a href="http://www.richarddawkins.net/">web site</a> with more details about his book along with details of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. It is absolutely great to see work like this being undertaken and I for one will do what I can to support it. People should not be ashamed or worried to come out as atheists, although some of the statistics and quotes in his book do make me realise that I am lucky to live in England where there is far less fundamentalism than in other parts of the world; although it does appear to be creeping in quietly and so vigilance is required.<br />
<br />
In closing this is a very good book, and I intend to read it again once I have finished my thesis and I have a little more time. I have so many other books I want to read too but I am glad I bumped this one up the queue!
