I have been using the monolithic KDE 3.4 beta ebuilds for quite a while now, and really like them. For the stuff I use I haven't found any problems either. The time has come to make a start on keywording the new split KDE ebuilds though, as they are certainly the best direction to go in the long run. The main problem is that there are just so many of them! I got kde-base/kdebase-meta-3.4-rc1 and all of its dependencies done today, but it is very time consuming...
