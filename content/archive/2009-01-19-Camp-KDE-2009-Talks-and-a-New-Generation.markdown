<span><p>It is Monday already, how time flies when you are having fun. I have seen some great talks, and given a couple of (halves of) talks on some of the work I do for <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>. <a href="http://camp.kde.org/">Camp KDE</a> has been very interesting, and after being frozen in Pittsburgh for months it is great to be able to wear shorts outside!</a></p>

<p>Gokmen and I gave a joint talk on KDE and distros. We talked about the work we do in <a href="http://www.pardus.org.tr/">Pardus</a> and <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>, along with more general issues we felt distros face and some of the KDE applications Gokmen is working on in Pardus.</p>

<p>I also gave a talk with Mauricio on KDE Edu and KDE Games. My part of the talk concentrated on the work I have been doing on <a href="http://kalzium.kde.org/">Kalzium</a> and <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/">Avogadro</a>. I got a chance to show off lots of the new eye candy added recently, along with the progress we have made in the latest Avogadro release. Many of these new features should make an appearance in KDE 4.3.</p>

<p>Mauricio and I also announced that we both have a new generation of KDE Edu users on the way <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> Today has been filled with with talks by Till Adam on how to make better use of Qt. I have had the opportunity to meet Alexandra Leisse and tell her all about Avogadro for a some work she is doing on featuring Qt applications. Then there is Bill Hoffman, the guy behind <a href="http://www.kitware.org/">Kitware</a> and <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> who gave a very interesting talk. I have had the chance to quiz him on several aspects of CMake, CPack and CDash.</p>

<p>I have to go to became a Qt movie star now...</p></span>
