Daniel Ribas very kindly made a far better hackergotchi than I think I could have, even after hours of trying... I would like to thank him and ask the powers that be to add it to the Planet please <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> I think it looks pretty good, even though I look like a floating head with hair wings.<br />

Unfortunately I am in a semi-conscious state today after spending the day doing the open water section of my rescue diver course... Hopefully I will do something more useful tomorrow like finish off the boinc version bump!
