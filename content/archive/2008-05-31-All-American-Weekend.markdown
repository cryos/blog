<span><p>What a hectic week. I never got chance to record our first all American weekend on the long weekend. We started off on Saturday morning shopping in the sales and found a great BBQ at Wal-Mart. It is nearly twice the size of the one we had back in the UK with a great labour saving ash collector at the bottom. We then loaded up on meat and other BBQ essentials.</p>

<p>Had lots of friends over on Saturday evening and then exposed our American friends to the <a href="http://www.eurovision.tv/">Eurovision song contest</a>! It was very hard to explain this phenomenon to them but it was as amusing as ever with expert commentary by Terry Wogan <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>

<p>Then on Sunday we went along to our first ever baseball game and saw the <a href="http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> beat the <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/">Chicago Cubs</a>. It was a really fun day out, beautiful sunny weekend and then we had another BBQ when we got back. I have always loved BBQs and our new one works great.</p>

<p>This weekend we are heading out on a road trip with a few friends from work. I haven't really taken any photos for about a year now so I am really hoping we can see a little of the country around us and get some photos I can show off. I would love more time for hacking on code too, may be Sunday evening when we get back. I have been seriously neglecting my new game too - <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/IV/">GTA IV</a>.</p></span>
