<span><p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.kitware.com/">Kitware</a> launched a <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/">new developer blog</a>. There are categories for the different areas Kitware operates in, such as <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/browse/topic/7">software process</a> (<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> &&amp; <a href="http://www.cdash.org/">friends</a>), <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/browse/topic/3">scientific visualization</a> (the area I work in, e.g. <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a>, <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">ParaView</a>), and our work in <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/browse/topic/8">open source</a>, which I am very passionate about. Check out Will Schroeder's post on <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/3">Why Open Source Will Rule Scientific Computing</a>, I think he makes some great points - in my own research career I witnessed how inadequate closed source options often are.</p>

<p>Bill Hoffman's post on <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/4">Deploying on Windows with DLL Manifest Issues</a> is something near and dear to my heart, I posted about similar issues last year in <a href="http://blog.cryos.net/archives/209-Manifest-Hell...The-New-DLL-Hell.html">DLL Hell...The New DLL Hell?</a> These recent changes will certainly go a long way to ensuring future developers can more easily validate Windows packages before distributing them. You can also check out my first post on visualizing the commit history of the VTK and CMake repositories in <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/5">VTK and CMake Code Swarms</a>.</p>

<p>I will get some more technical posts up soon too! Exciting things happening, still enjoying my new job at Kitware.</p>
