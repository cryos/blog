Just to balance out my blog a little I thought I would add a note about what a nice weekend I had doing my trainee divemaster internship with <a href="http://www.tigerdive.co.uk/">Tigerdive</a> last weekend at <a href="http://www.dive-site.co.uk/">Capernwray</a> dive centre. I was helping Lynda with the Advanced Open Water course. We had four students who were all really nice. They had a few small problems but overall the whole weekend seemed to go really well.<br />
<br />
I got to feed the fish, I got the last of the open water dive sign offs I need for my <a href="http://www.padi.com/">PADI</a> divemaster course and we had a great weekend. The trainee divemasters also qualified on the Saturday evening - hopefully I will do the same at the end of the month. I stayed at <a href="http://www.capernwrayhouse.com/">Capernwray house</a> just down the road instead of camping this weekend and it was a great place to stay. Should hopefully be staying there on my last trainee weekend too.<br />
<br />
I got a great tired diver tow time and completed my rescue assessment too. The course has been pretty tough but I feel like the end is in sight now. I just need to get a few more exams done and complete my mapping exercise. I have really enjoyed diving over the summer and am glad I took up the divemaster course. It has been tough finding the time necessary as I am also very busy writing up my thesis which is a little delayed right now. I should really get some sleep now...
