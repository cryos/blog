<span><p>What a busy year it has been so far, a leap day hardly seems enough to help me catch up! I started off the year with a meeting in Cambridge, England on Semantic Physical Science which was hosted by <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/">Peter Murray-Rust</a>. I ended up leading the working group on <a href="http://www.xml-cml.org/">CML</a> and the developing a roadmap to move forward. <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/01/26/marcus-hanwell-the-way-ahead-for-cml-and-the-community/">Peter blogged about this on my birthday</a> (by chance) and you can see the <a href="http://vimeo.com/35400550">video of my summing up of the results</a>, along with all the <a href="http://vimeo.com/petermr">other videos from the final day</a>.</p>

<p>While I was back in England I took the opportunity to visit friends and family, along with a day trip to Liverpool to meet with Abbie and Jens. While I was there we discussed some plans around alternate inputs for <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/">Avogadro</a> for an upcoming MP visit at the end of January. I found some time to <a href="http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/232">blog about that on the Kitware blog</a>, and Abbie <a href="http://www.pore-behaviour.com/report2.html">wrote up the visit</a> on their site. I think engaging more people in chemistry is important, and whilst I don't think the interaction is ideal at the moment I was pleased to see them enjoying it. The Kinect is something that many groups can purchase, and if it helps engage a wider audience in science I think that is a great thing.</p>

<p>I am very excited about the work we are doing in <a href="http://openchemistry.org/">Open Chemistry</a> at <a href="http://www.kitware.com/">Kitware</a>. We have been bringing web sites and testing online, and have begun engaging more people in the development process. The official announcement of <a href="http://www.kitware.com/news/home/browse/OpenChemistry?2012_01_24&Kitware+Receives+Phase+II+Funding+for+the+Development+of+a+Computational+Chemistry+Workbench">our Phase II funding</a> went out in January too, and I set up an <a href="https://plus.google.com/114547712877150296237/posts">Open Chemistry group on Google+</a> if you would like to follow new developments there.</p>

<p>I am especially excited after meeting some people from <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/">EMSL</a> at the Semantic Physical Science meeting in Cambridge about the possibilities of working with <a href="http://www.nwchem-sw.org/">NWChem</a> more in the future. The open source license they switched to last year is of a very similar liberal nature to that of many of the open source projects we work on at Kitware. There are a large array of techniques available in NWChem, and interest in correlating computational and experimental observables.</p>

<p>We have also been extending Gerrit to support topic branch reviews, and switched <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a> to use it for all code submissions. You can see <a href="http://review.source.kitware.com/#/q/entity:topic%20status:open+project:VTK,n,z">proposed topics</a> and they will trigger automatic build tests using CDash@Home for members of the core group. The Open Chemistry projects are also using the same Gerrit server for code review, and I am adding automated build testing of topics as I find time (any more leap days would help).</p>

<p>As my extra day draws to a close I realize there is still so much more I should get down. I will aim for more discipline in adding more regular entries here, you can <a href="https://plus.google.com/113975743934359964892/posts">follow my Google+ updates</a> if you would like more updates on open source, open science and the life of a scientific software developer.</p></span>
