<p>I will be talking about the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/openchemistry/">Open Chemistry Project</a> at <a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> this year in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/foss_for_scientists/">FOSS for scientists devroom</a> at 12:30pm on Saturday. I will discuss the development of a suite of tools for computational chemists and related disciplines, which includes the development of three desktop applications addressing 3D molecular structure editing, input preparation, output analysis, cheminformatics and integration with high-performance computing resources.</p>

<p>On Sunday <a href="http://www.kitware.com/company/team/hoffman.html">Bill Hoffman</a> will be speaking in the main track about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/open_science/">Open Science, Open Software, and Reproducible Code</a> at 3pm on Sunday. Bill and Alexander Neundorf will also be talking about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/moderncmake/">Modern CMake</a> in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/cross_desktop/">cross desktop devroom</a> on Saturday.</p>

<p>FOSDEM is one of the first conferences I attended (possibly the first, I can't remember if I went to a science conference before this). It will be great to return after so many years, and hopefully meet old colleagues and a few new ones. Please find me, Bill or Alex if you would like to discuss any of this work with us. I fly out tomorrow, and hope to get over jet lag quickly. Once FOSDEM is over we will be visiting <a href="http://www.kitware.com/company/team_keu.html">Kitware SAS</a> in Lyon, France for a couple of days (this is my first trip to our new office).</p>

<p>Then I have a few days in England visiting friends and family before heading back to the US.</p>
