Just found out that my first paper has been pubilshed! It was published on the 27th of May with the title 'Evidence of collinear ferrimagnetism in (Fe, Tb)B metallic glasses from polarized beam neutron scattering' in the Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter. You can look at the abstract <a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0953-8984/17/23/011">here</a> and I believe the PDF can be downloaded for free by anyone.<br />
<br />
They also picked our article to go in IoP Select! This was quite an honour for me with my first paper - I am second name on it too. Hopefully there will be many more high quality papers to come too.
