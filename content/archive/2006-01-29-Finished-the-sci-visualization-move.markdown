Well I finished the sci-visualization move today, so we have a new category for all the scientific visualisation applications. There are a couple of applications we had been holding off adding until after the move that should go in soon too. As far as I can tell there was one small bug with a  reverse dependency that was missed. I have scanned through the tree and cannot find anything else, but please shout at me if you do <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> It is good to have a specific category for visualisation applications as they were generally in media-gfx or sci-mathematics and it is quite a large area for us scientists - analysing and showing off our data.
