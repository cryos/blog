<span><p>Over the last few days we have been working on improving the look and feel of the <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/">Avogadro</a> user interface. We owe both <a href="http://www.qtsoftware.com/">Qt Software</a> and <a href="http://www.oxygen-icons.org/">the Oxygen icon team</a> a lot for making this process a lot easier. Avogadro uses quite a few Oxygen icons that we have taken and in some cases adapted slightly.</p>

<p>The sliver of screen shot above shows our tools tool bar, along with the tool and display settings buttons. We are pretty happy with the majority of the icons, which are (from left to right) draw, navigate, bond-centric manipulation, atom centric manipulation, selection, auto rotation (animated rotation about axes), auto optimise (continuous optimisation of the molecule geometry), z-matrix, measure and align tools.</p>

<p>I would really welcome any suggestions and/or icon submissions for the auto rotate (the spinny thing near the centre), and the auto optimise (the wand with the circle) tools. I think auto rotate is OK, but it would be better if it conveyed more of a three dimensional rotation. The auto optimise wand is perhaps the worst as it does not suggest optimisation of the geometry, but I am not sure what would. Do any of you more creative types have any suggestions?</p>

<p>I also wonder if there are nice icons we could use for tool and display settings, or a way to make those buttons smaller without losing discoverability. I look forward to hearing people's thoughts. As this is what people see when they first open Avogadro we would like to make the interface as inviting and intuitive as possible.</p></span>
