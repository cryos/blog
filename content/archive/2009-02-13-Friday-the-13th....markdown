<span><p>So it is Friday the 13th... At about 5am this morning my server emailed me to tell me one of its disks was down... It is all RAID1 (apart from swap) and so it is mostly OK. I think having half its swap removed upset it quite a bit though, and so almost all services died. I think they are all back up and running again, but if you emailed anything in the last day or so you might want to resend it.</p>

<p>This week has not been my finest - hopefully next week will be much better! Here's hoping nothing else went terribly wrong this week, and that it is just the disk and not the whole server that is having trouble. So much to do, I did not need this.</p></span>
