I wrote my first webapp ebuild the other day - for serendipity 1.0. I have been using it to power my blog for quite some time now. I asked <a href="http://www.sebastian-bergmann.de/blog/">Sebastian Bergmann</a> who is a member of upstream and a Gentoo dev if he would mind me knocking together an ebuild for it months ago and I finally got around to getting it all working over the weekend with a little help from Jakub and Chtekk.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://blog.stuartherbert.com/gentoo.php">Stuart</a> sorted my write access out for the <a href="http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/webapps/">Webapps overlay</a> so I could add it there initially. Check it out, let me know how it works and if you can spot any bugs <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> Hopefully it will work well for people and be allowed into the main portage tree once the necessary checks have been done on it.<br />
