Well after much messing about, and some pretty poor after sales service I have cancelled my root server order with 1&1. The rumours were true - different members of staff quote much different time scales from days to weeks, and frankly the person I spoke to on the phone was quite rude. I had already waited nearly two weeks and was led to believe they were able to deploy servers within a week when I first ordered.<br />
<br />
So back to looking at dedicated server options with root, preferably using Gentoo Linux with reasonable bandwidth allowances in the UK... I am playing with the idea of building a 2U solution myself and colocating! I have made plenty of server systems already, just no rackmount systems yet. 1U seems pretty difficult, but 2U looks fairly simple. Whilst I am building it I will also get time to think about where I colocate too.
