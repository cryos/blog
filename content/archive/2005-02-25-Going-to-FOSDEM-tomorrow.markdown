Well it is the night before I will set out to Brussels, Belgium with Louise. This will be my first big open source conference, and also a great chance to meet some other developers. It is also my first trip on Eurostar, and my first trip to Belgium! I am really looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
I have been a developer for about two months now, and I hope that I have already succeeded in enriching Gentoo as already. I have my GPG key fingerprint printed out for the key signing event, I just need to hope that the snow has finished as travelling in snow like we have had today would be a nightmare.
