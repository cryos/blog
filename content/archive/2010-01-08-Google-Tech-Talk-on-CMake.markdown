<span><p>Bill Hoffman gave a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/googletechtalks">Google Tech Talk</a> on 7 December 2009 at Google's New York city office on CMake, CTest, CDash and CPack. Google recently made the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ut9o4OdSC0">talk available on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>I wish I could have made it down with Bill and Will to see Google's New York office. For anyone attending <a href="http://camp.kde.org/">Camp KDE</a>, I will be discussing some of these concepts there too, but with a focus on the software process and testing components of <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>.</p></span>
