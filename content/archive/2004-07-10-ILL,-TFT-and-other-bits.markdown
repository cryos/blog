Still managing to prove that I am not very good at writing regularly... It was quite successful over at ILL, although very intense. We got an extra half day on D17, but that meant that I had to go in to ILL at 6PM after arriving in Grenoble at 5PM!!! I think we worked until about 12:30AM that evening and then went back in the following day for about 9:30AM.<br />
<br />
The runs had to be quite long, between 5 and 6 hours. This meant that we couldn't run anywhere near all the samples I had prepared - so I had to pick the best ones to go on and leave the rest. We only had two days on D17 but I learnt so much in that time. Andrew explained how to operate the instrument, and showed me LAMP and how things can be automated by scripting them in LAMP.<br />
<br />
Altogether we only got reflectivity profiles of 7 samples - one gold nanoparticle sample right at the end along with mainly C16O3 with and without Li ions, and one C16O4 sample. Now the task of analysing all the data begins - Andrew was very helpful though and explained how to use Cosmos to extract profiles from the raw data.<br />
<br />
Also managed to get a TFT screen finally! It is a very nice 17" LG TFT screen that arrived on Friday. I will be getting one for home very soon too - it is so much nicer to work on than even my Iiyama 19" CRT screen (and so much smaller).<br />
<br />
It would have been Aaron's 21st birthday on Monday, so I have been feeling pretty down about that... It never seems to get any easier. Mum seems to be taking it pretty hard too - I hope she is OK.<br />
<br />
That is it for now anyway...
