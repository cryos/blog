<span><p>I attended my first <a href="http://akademy2007.kde.org/">aKademy</a> conference this year in Glasgow. On Sunday I gave a talk on Gentoo &amp; KDE, you can get the <a href="http://blog.cryos.net/uploads/MDHanwell-aKademy2007.pdf">slides here</a> and <a href="http://home.kde.org/~akademy07/videos/1-21-Gentoo_KDE.ogg">download a video of my talk</a> (warning - 107.6 MB). You can also see all the other talks and videos/slides on the <a href="http://akademy2007.kde.org/conference/programme.php">programme page</a>.</p>

<p>I think the talk went well and it was certainly useful for me to meet lots of KDE developers. I was there for the whole conference and had the opportunity to learn a lot from some really great talks. There was no internet connection for the first day and a half which prevented me from bloggging and checking my mail but did let me give my full attention to the talks.</p>

<p>I think my talk was well received and got some interesting questions. I also had some very interesting discussions after the talk and look forward to getting some work done on the KDE 4 ebuilds. I am still around for the rest of the week playing both the Kalzium GSoC student and the Gentoo developer.</p>

<p>I hope that my talk was of interest to those who attended it or watch it on the internet. My greatest hope was that my talk would help to improve the way we work with KDE and I feel I have achieved that goal. The next few months will tell just how successful I really was. I will be giving another talk at the <a href="http://www.genbot.co.uk/">Gentoo UK conference</a> on 14 July on KDE and scientific applications.</p></span>
