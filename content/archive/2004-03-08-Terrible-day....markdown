What a terrible day! Spent all day in the lab, but only actually managed to desposit 4 layers on to one glass slide. That particular glass slide does actually look very uniform, which is promising, but it took a whole day. The diamond glass cutter has also gone missing, and the trough took an absolute age to clean...<br />
<br />
I did get the posters up for the staff-student quiz though, and they look pretty good. Let's hope for a more productive day tomorrow.
