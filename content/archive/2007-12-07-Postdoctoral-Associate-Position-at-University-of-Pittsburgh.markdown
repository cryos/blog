<span><p>At the start of October I began my first postdoctoral position, at the <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a> in the <a href="http://www.chem.pitt.edu/">Chemistry Department</a> working in the newly formed <a href="http://hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/">Hutchison Group</a> for <a href="http://geoffhutchison.net/blog/">Geoffrey Hutchison</a>. Life has been so hectic these last few months finishing my doctorate and preparing for my biggest move ever.</p>

<p>Louise and I arrived on the 27th of September and had less than a week to find a suitable apartment out here ready for me to start work. I am now a legal non-resident alien (I think - someone correct me if I got it wrong). I am very excited to be starting this new job, the move has been really tough but the research looks very interesting and I am sure that my time here will be very productive.</p>

<p>I have already been to quite a few interesting talks in the department and am making the transition from physics to chemistry. It is OK though as I get to do lots of physics and programming along with some more chemistry. Exciting times and I am sure I will talk more about my work in future. I have already posted a tutorial article on <a href="http://www.macresearch.org/lab_journal_installing_sun_grid_engine_on_xserve_cluster">installing Sun Grid Engine on a Mac OS X cluster</a>.</p>

<p>Dax made it out here and we are both enjoying the recent snow. This entry sat in drafts for about a month or so as I have been so busy sorting things out, coding, reading and going to physio for my high ankle sprain which I am told is both unusual and the worst kind of sprain...</p></span>
