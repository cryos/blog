<span><p>Today was a beautiful day (as have been the last few) so I took a break from writing my thesis to get out for a while. We went out by Ladybower reservoir for a walk with Dax. It was great to get out of the office for a few hours after having quite an intense week of work. Lots more to do but it has been a productive week.</p>

<p>As you can see in the photo the weather really was great although it was really crowded out there too. Dax enjoyed himself and I got some nice pictures too. We came back and had a barbecue. It is really nice now the weather has improved and it isn't getting dark so early.</p>

<p>In other everyday news I got my new office chair too. It was a bit rubbish so I transplanted the arms to my old chair and all is well <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> Even got a foot stool out of it as it seemed a shame to waste the rest of the bits. I am hoping to spend a little less time in the office once I get my thesis finished though...</p></span>
