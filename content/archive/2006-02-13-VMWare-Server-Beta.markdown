Well after reading <a href="http://planet.gentoo.org/developers/flameeyes/2006/02/10/and_vmware_server_it_is">Diego's post about VMWare server</a> I thought I would have to check that one out myself. I tried out Mike's original ebuilds in <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56881">bug 56881</a>, but haven't had chance to try out the updated ebuilds in the new <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122500">bug he opened</a>. I would like to thank Mike for all his work, the ebuilds worked fine on my dual core amd64 SMP system and I have been happily making a few test VMs with it.<br />

This should be great for being able to play with bleeding edge environments in their own sandboxes and easily letting other people try out Gentoo without install whether they are using Linux or Windows. I just need some more disk space now!
