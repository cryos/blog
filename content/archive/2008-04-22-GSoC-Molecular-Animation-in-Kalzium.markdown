<span><p>I am very pleased to be able to announce that <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/kde/appinfo.html?csaid=4A166875B1873692">Naomi Fox's application</a> for a <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code (TM)</a> was successful. Some of you may remember that I participated last year as a student and was also lucky enough to attend <a href="http://akademy.kde.org/">aKademy</a>. This year I am no longer a student but I am very pleased to be able to participate as a mentor and hopefully pass on some of what I learned last year.</p>

<p>I hope you will all join me in welcoming Naomi to our development community. As I moved to the US last year we are actually in the same timezone which will make mentoring easier. It does mean getting to aKademy will be a lot more difficult but may be I can attend the first <a href="http://troy-at-kde.livejournal.com/15657.html">KDE Americas</a> event. I am really looking forward to working with Naomi over the summer and I think this is a really important set of features still missing in Kalzium.</p>

<p>Looking forward to a great summer, my first in Pittsburgh and my first time as a mentor.</p></span>
