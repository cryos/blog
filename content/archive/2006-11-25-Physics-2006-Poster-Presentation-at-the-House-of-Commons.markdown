I am going to <a href="http://www.setforeurope.org/Physics2006/phys06index.htm">Phyics 2006</a> poster presentation event at the House of Commons on Tuesday. I designed my poster using <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> and the a0poster class as I have for previous conferences. I am really happy with the poster and hopefully it will be well received at the reception.<br />
<br />
The poster summarises the three main elements of my PhD work - structural characterisation, UV lithography and sensing/electrical characteristics of the thiol encapsulated gold nanoparticles I work with. I will put up a PDF of the poster after the event - don't want to give anything away until then. I have it here along with my invitation and train tickets.<br />
<br />
It was a hectic day Friday getting it all printed and ready, making sure that it is narrow enough and that all the diagrams and gradients came out OK.
