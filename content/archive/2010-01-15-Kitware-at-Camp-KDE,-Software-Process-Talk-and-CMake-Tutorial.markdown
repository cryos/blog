<span><p><a href="http://www.kitware.com/">Kitware</a> is very kindly sending me to <a href="http://camp.kde.org/">Camp KDE</a>. I will be giving a talk on Sunday about <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>, testing, software process and new features in the recent CMake 2.8.0 release. I will also be running a training session on CMake on Monday afternoon. See you all there!</p>

<p>I will also be available to talk about many other things, such as the migration to git, open source chemistry, open science and scientific visualization. Since I joined Kitware I have been exploring some crazy cool ideas in new areas of visualization too, hopefully my influence has not been too disruptive. I will be on the lookout for potential Qties to join my team of Qties at Kitware - be warned <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p>

<p>Looking forward to my second Camp KDE! We should arrive in San Diego Friday afternoon, not looking forward to the security lines... I will of course be bringing my spawned process (now named William), who was but a bump at the last Camp KDE. His Mum will be in attendance too, having to travel on her birthday. I am in the last few weeks of my twenties, so be kind.</p></span>
