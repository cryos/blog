Ordered a dedicated root server II from 1&1 last night, and was pretty excited to be getting a new server. Their site was pretty vague about how long it takes them to set up the server so I gave it a while. I phoned them up today and waited for over 15 minutes to talk to someone who was quite rude when he anwered! Apparently it takes five working days, although I fail to understand why they cannot be upfront and put this on their web site. He didn't even pause to think about it!<br />
<br />
When I asked him if I received an email to notify me that the server had been set up he promptly replied no, and said I had to just keep checking my control panel randomly! I found this quite hard to swallow. They do have a 60 day money back guarantee, and from the poor start they got off to I may need it. I will remain patient and keep an open mind, but if they charge for the waiting time I will not be happy.<br />

If I ever get the server it should be a positive step forward though. I intend to install Gentoo onto it once I get access of course. It is a P4 2.4 GHz I think, with 1 GB of RAM and an 80 GB hard drive. They also bundle 100 GB of transfer with that, but I fear at the price of poor customer service. Time will tell, but first impressions are not very good at all.
