<span><p>I just made a few commits using my trusty git svn dcommit (I am still really loving git and it looks like the bug I reported may be fixed in it now too). Then I saw the commit numbers - we just hit commit 1000. Development has really been accelerating recently and I haven't had time to write about as much as I wish I could.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will get a chance to take some screenshots and show off some of the latest stuff. I have coded a QGraphicsView based periodic table I am pretty happy with. It is compact, allows elements to be chosen, shows our colour scheme and even displays a little extra information on the selected element. Then there is the ribbon engine which is coming along but needs some loving attention from some bio people.</p>

<p>I am very pleased with the new quick rendering stuff we have added. It still has its issues. I had fixed some but some of Benoit's recent commits seem to have reintroduced the cache problem upon engine changes. Tim has added a new hydrogen bond engine which looks great thanks to some stipple line stuff from Geoff. There is some great stuff in the properties dialogs too along with lots of improvements to our force fields.</p>

<p>There is certainly lots more for us to do. The biggest thing I still haven't gotten in yet is surface support! I really want to get that sorted as I think it will be both useful and should look great. Along with some extra dialogs for graphics export, POV-Ray rendering etc.</p></span>
