I thought I would bow to peer pressure and show a picture of my desk in its natural state. I admit it - I tidied my desk for the picture that was published in the Gentoo Weekly Newsletter <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /> It is especially bad right now as I am preparing for a conference in Japan which is only weeks away.<br />

If there are any devs in Japan at the moment I will be in Tokyo the week after the conference (4-8 July) - it would be great to meet up with some of you guys, may be sign each others GPG keys and have a few beers (or is it saki?) whilst I am out there. Back to work anyway...
