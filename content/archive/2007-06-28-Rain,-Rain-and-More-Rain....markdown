<span><p>The last week has been pretty surreal. I was in work on Monday getting a bit of work done when we had some really heavy rain. The commute home was a nightmare and I was glad I left early. It seems that I had a lucky escape though as in Sheffield (where I live and work) we have had some of the worst floods I have ever known. Rivers have burst their banks and literally washed cars down the road.</p>

<p>Unfortunately a few people have also died in the midst of the floods. A nearby dam has also developed cracks in its walls  which led to sections of the M1 being closed along with nearby homes getting evacuated. Rolling power cuts and the threat of more rain this weekend make life in Sheffield pretty difficult. We have been fortunate to have escaped most of the problems where we live and have not had any flooding or power cuts. A <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/6248102.stm">recent article on events</a> shows some of the problems faced by our city.</p></span>
