<span><p>I term it as "ribbon" because it really isn't a ribbon. I haven't figured out how to calculate the plane the ribbon lies on and right now it is a series of cylinders drawn from point to point. I hope you will agree that it already looks fairly effective and can certainly show the nature of the secondary structure of biological molecules.</p>

<p>There is still a lot to do such as draw the tube in a more efficient manner as a continuous OpenGL construct and draw each residue separately. It would also be good to be able to draw ribbons but this may take a deeper understanding of ribbons and how they are visualised than I have. If there are any biologists out there who want to help me out then tips, or even better patches, would be great fully received <img src="http://blog.cryos.net/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p></span>
